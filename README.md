_crucio_ is an educational crossword generator I wrote in C++ (2006). The program output can be converted to LaTeX with _cruciotex_, of which [this is an example](/sample.pdf).

My first profitable iOS app, [Word Fill](https://j.mp/wordfill) (2011), is based on _crucio_.

_crucio_ is the subject of [my thesis on crossword generators](/thesis.pdf) (Italian).
